### Communication

If the defacement has been visible for part of your users, plan to explain the incident publicly.

### Report

A crisis report should be written and made available to all of the involved parties.

The following themes should be described:

- Initial detection;
- Actions and timelines;
- What went right;
- What went wrong;
- Incident cost.

In case of vulnerability discovery, **report any undocumented vulnerability** lying on a product running on the web server (like a PHP forum) to its editor, so that the code can be upgraded in order to release a fix.

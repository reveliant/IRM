If data has been sent to public servers, ask the owner (or webmaster) to remove the disclosed data. Be sure to adjust your request to the recipients (hacktivism webmaster won’t behave as a press webmaster)

If it’s not possible to remove the disclosed data, provide a complete analysis to the PR team and the management. Monitor leaked documents spread on websites and social networks (FB, Twitter, etc) and Internet user’s comments or reactions.

Provide the elements to HR team to eventually file a complaint against the insider.

Pull the network plug off physically, to prevent more infection on the network and to stop any actions being done from your computer (e.g. the malware could be sending spam, taking part in a DDoS attack or storing illegal files on the system).

Send the suspect binaries to your CERT, or request CERT’s help if you are unsure about the malware’s nature. The CERT should be able to isolate the malicious content and can send it to all AV companies, including your corporate contractors. (The best way is to create a zipped, password-encrypted file of the suspicious binary.)

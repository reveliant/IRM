If possible reinstall the OS and applications and restore userâ€™s data from clean, trusted backups. If deemed necessary, you may ask your local IT helpdesk to reimage the disk.

In case the computer has not been reinstalled completely:

**Restore files which could have been corrupted by the malware**, especially system files.

**Reboot the machine** after all the suspicious files have been removed, and confirm that the workstation is not exhibiting any unusual behaviour. A full, up-to-date AV scan of the hard-drive and memory are recommended.

- A physical access to the suspicious system should be given to the forensic investigator. Physical access is preferred to remote access, since the hacker could detect the investigations done on the system (by using a network sniffer for example).
- A physical copy of the hard-disk might be necessary for forensic and evidence purposes. Finally, if needed, a physical access could be needed to disconnect the suspected machine from any network.
- A good knowledge of the usual network activity of the machine/server is needed. You should have a file on a secure place describing the usual port activity, to compare efficiently to the current state.
- A good knowledge of the usual services running on the machine can be very helpful. Donâ€™t hesitate to ask a Windows Expert for his assistance, when applicable. A good idea is also to have a map of all services/running process of the machine.

It can be a real advantage to work in a huge corporate environment, where all user machines are the same, installed from a master CD. Have a map of all processes/services/applications. On such environment where users are not allowed to install software, consider any additional process/service/application as suspicious.

**The more you know the machine in its clean state, the more chances you have to detect any fraudulent activity running from it.**

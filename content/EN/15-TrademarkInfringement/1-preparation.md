- Maintain a list of all legitimate trademarks belonging to your company and its subsidiaries. This will help in assessing the situation at hand and prevent you from starting an infringement procedure on an outdated trademark, an unrelated legitimate website or social network account.
- Establish a thorough, evidence-based information list related to your trademarks to support your legal rights:
  - Name(s), legitimate domain names and social media accounts used by your company and its subsidiaries;
  - Your trademarked words, symbols, taglines, graphicsâ€¦
  - Trademark registration numbers if applicable;
  - International and federal/local trademark registration offices (USPTO, INPI, etc.) where registered trademarks have been labelled as such if applicable;
  - Any other document establishing clearly that a trademark belongs to your company.
- Prepare trademark infringement e-mail forms. You will use them for every trademark infringement case, if possible in several languages. This will help speed up things when trying to reach out the registrar, service provider and any other relevant party during the procedure.
- Promote a central domain management system using normalized WHOIS fields.
- Promote an ethical online advertisement to avoid appearing in parked domain names.

### Internal contacts

- Maintain a list of all people involved in trademark registration in the company especially those part of the legal and PR departments.
- Maintain a list of all people accredited to take decisions on trademarks and eventual actions regarding trademark infringement. If possible, obtain a written agreement that gives you the ability to take this kind of decisions.

### External contacts

- Establish and maintain a list of external contacts within registrars and service providers involved in trademark issues.

weight: 4
objective: Take actions to stop the trademark infringement.

In most trademark issues, monitoring is usually sufficient. Remediation must be started only if there’s an impact on your company or its subsidiaries.

### Domain name

- Contact the domain name owner and hosting service provider to notify them of the trademark infringement and ask them to remove the fraudulent content.
- Contact the domain name registrar to notify them of the trademark infringement and ask them to deactivate the associated domain name or to transfer it to you.
- Ask the domain name owner or registrar to redirect all DNS requests to your name servers if possible.
- If neither the domain name owner nor the registrar comply with your requests, initiate an Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) procedure if you are empowered to do so or ask the internal contacts to conduct it.

### Social network account

- Contact the service provider of the infringing page, group or account to notify them of any violation of their Trademark Policies or Terms of Service and ask them to deactivate the infringing account.
- Ask the service provider to transfer the trademarked account to an existing company account if possible.

In both cases, send e-mails to the contact addresses of the registrar or service provider. There’s generally an e-mail address to report abuse, legal or copyright issues.

Fill out a trademark or abuse complain form if available.

Notify the management, legal and PR team to make sure they are prepared to deal with a massive or targeted disclosure.

Depending on the leakage vector, block the access to the disclosure URI, the disclosure server, the disclosure source or the disclosure recipients. This action must be done on all infrastructure points.

Suspend the logical and physical credentials of the insider if the leakage has been confirmed. Involve HR and legal team before any action.

Isolate the computing system (desktop, printer) used to disclose data in order to perform a forensic analysis later. This manipulation should be done the hard way: remove the electric plug (and the battery in case of a laptop).

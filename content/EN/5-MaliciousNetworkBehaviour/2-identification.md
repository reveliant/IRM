title: Identification
weight: 2
objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.
---
Sources of detection:

- Notification by user/helpdesk;
- IDS alert;
- Detection by network staff;
- Complain from an external source.

### Record suspect network activity

Network frames can be stored into a file and transmitted to your incident response team for further analysis.

Use network capture tools (tshark, windump, tcpdump…) to dump malicious traffic. Use a hub or port mirroring on an affected LAN to collect valuable data.

Network forensic requires skills and knowledge . Ask your incident response team for assistance or advices.

### Analyze the attack

- Analyze alerts generated by your IDS;
- Review statistics and logs of network devices;
- Try to understand the goal of the malicious traffic and identify the infrastructure components affected by it;
- Identify the technical characteristics of the traffic:
  - Source IP address(es)
  - Ports used, TTL, Packet ID, …
  - Protocols used
  - Targeted machines/services
  - Exploit(s)
  - Remote accounts logged in

***At the end of this step, the impacted machines and the modus operandi of the attack should have been identified. Ideally, the source of the attack should have been identified as well. This is where you should do your forensic investigations, if needed.***

***If a compromised computer has been identified, check IRM cheat sheets dedicated to intrusion.***

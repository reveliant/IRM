### Block the source

- Using analysis from previous steps identification and containment, find out all communication channels used by the attacker and block them on all your network boundaries.
- If the source has been identified as an insider, take appropriate actions and involve your management and/or HR team and/or legal team.
- If the source has been identified as an external offender, consider involving abuse teams and law enforcement services if required.

### Technical remediation

- Define a remediation process. If necessary, this process can be validated by another structure, like your incident response team for example.
- Remediation steps from intrusion IRM can also be useful.

### Test and enforce

- Test the remediation process and make sure that it properly works without damaging any service.
- Enforce the remediation process once tests have been approved by both IT and business.

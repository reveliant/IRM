weight: 4
objective: Take actions to stop the fraud.

- In case the fraudulent phishing pages are hosted on a compromised website, try to contact the owner of the website. Explain clearly the fraud to the owner, so that he takes appropriate actions: remove the fraudulent content, and most of all upgrade the security on it, so that the fraudster cannot come back using the same vulnerability.
- In any case, also contact the hosting company of the website. Send e-mails to the contact addresses of the hosting company (generally there is an abuse@hostingcompany) then try to get someone on the phone, to speed things up.
- Contact the e-mail hosting company to shut down the fraudulent accounts which receive the stolen credentials or credit card information (Either on an “e-mail only” phishing case or on a usual one, if you managed to get the destination e-mail address).
- In case there is a redirection (the link contained in the e-mail often goes to a redirecting URL) also take down the redirection by contacting the company responsible for the service.

In case you get no answer, or no action is taken, don’t hesitate to call back and send e-mails on a regular basis, every two hours for example.

- If the takedown is too slow, contact a local CERT in the involved country, which could help taking down the fraud.

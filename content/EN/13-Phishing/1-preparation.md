weight: 1
objective: Establish contacts, define procedures, gather information to save time during an attack.

- Create a list of all legitimate domains belonging to your company. This will help analysing the situation, and prevent you from starting a takedown procedure on a forgotten legitimate website.
- Prepare one web page hosted on your infrastructure, ready to be published anytime, to warn your customers about an ongoing phishing attack. Prepare and test a clear deployment procedure as well.
- Prepare takedown e-mail forms. You will use them for every phishing case, if possible in several languages. This will speed up things when trying to reach the hosting company etc. during the takedown process.

### Internal contacts

- Maintain a list of all people involved in domain names registration in the company.
- Maintain a list of all people accredited to take decisions on cybercrime and eventual actions regarding phishing. If possible, have a contract mentioning you can take decisions.

### External contacts

- Have several ways to be reached in a timely manner (24/7 if possible):
  - E-Mail address, easy to remember for everyone (ex: security@yourcompany)
  - Web forms on your company’s website (location of the form is important, no more than 2 clicks away from the main page)
  - Visible Twitter account
- Establish and maintain a list of takedown contacts in:
  - Hosting companies
  - Registry companies
  - E-Mail providers
- Establish and maintain contacts in CERTs worldwide, they will probably always be able to help if needed.

### Raise customer awareness

Don’t wait for phishing incidents to communicate with your customers. Raise awareness about phishing fraud, explain what phishing is and make sure your customers know you won’t ever ask them for credentials/banking information by e-mail or on the phone.

### Raise business line awareness

People in business lines must be aware of phishing problems and consider security as a priority. Therefore, they should apply good practices such as avoid sending links (URL) to customers, and use a signature stating that the company will never ask them for credential/banking information online.

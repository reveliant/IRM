### Phishing Detection

- Monitor all your points of contact closely (e-mail, web forms, etc.)
- Deploy spam traps and try to gather spam from partners/third-parties.
- Deploy active monitoring of phishing repositories, like AA419 or PhishTank for example.
- Monitor any specialised mailing-list you can have access to, or any RSS/Twitter feed, which could be reporting phishing cases.

Use automated monitoring systems on all of these sources, so that every detection triggers an alarm for instant reaction.

- Monitor your web logs. Check there is no suspicious referrer bringing people to your website. This is often the case when the phishing websites brings the user to the legitimate website after he’s been cheated.

### Involve appropriate parties

As soon as a phishing website is detected, contact the people in your company who are accredited to take a decision, if not you.
The decision to act on the fraudulent website/e-mail address must be taken as soon as possible, within minutes.

### Collect evidence

Make a time-stamped copy of the phishing web pages. Use an efficient tool to do that, like HTTrack for example. Don’t forget to take every page of the phishing scheme, not just the first one if there are several. If needed, take screenshots of the pages.

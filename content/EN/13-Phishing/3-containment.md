- Spread the URL of the attack in case of a phishing website.

  Use every way you have to spread the fraudulent URL on every web browser: use the options of Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Netcraft toolbar, Phishing-Initiative, etc.

  This will prevent the users from accessing the website while you work on the remediation phase.
- Spread the fraudulent e-mail content on spam-reporting websites/partners.
- Communicate with your customers.

Deploy the alert/warning page with information about the current phishing attack.

In case you are impacted several times a week, don’t always deploy an alert/warning message but rather a very informative phishing page to raise awareness.

- Check the source-code of the phishing website.
  - See where the data is exported: either to another web content you cannot access (a PHP script usually), or sent by e-mail to the fraudster.
  - Watch how the phishing-page is built. Do the graphics come from one of your legitimate website, or are they stored locally?
If possible, in case the graphics are taken from one of your own websites, you could change the graphics to display a “PHISHING WEBSITE” logo on the fraudster’s page.

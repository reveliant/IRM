weight: 3
objective: Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.

- Spread the fraudulent e-mail content on spam/fraud reporting websites/partners/tools.
- Communicate with your customers.

Deploy the alert/warning page with information about the current scam attack if the brand is impacted.

In case you are impacted several times a week, don’t always deploy an alert/warning message but rather a very informative page about scam, to raise awareness.

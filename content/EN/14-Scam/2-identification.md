### Fraudulent scam detection

- Monitor all your points of contact closely (e-mail, web forms, etc.)
- Deploy spam traps and try to gather spam from partners/third-parties.
- Deploy active monitoring of scam repositories, like 419scam or Millersmiles for example.
- Monitor any specialised mailing-list you can have access to, or any RSS/Twitter feed, which could be reporting scam letters.

Use automated monitoring systems on all of these sources, so that every detection triggers an alarm for instant reaction.

### Involve appropriate parties

As soon as a scam campaign is detected, contact the people in your company who are accredited to take a decision, if not you.
The decision to act on the fraudulent e-mail address must be taken as soon as possible, within minutes.

### Collect evidence

Get samples of the fraudulent e-mails sent by the fraudsters. Be careful to collect the e-mail headers in addition to the e-mail content. Collect several e-mails if possible, to check for the real senderâ€™s IP address. This will help the investigation, analyzing if the campaign is sent from one machine or from a botnet.

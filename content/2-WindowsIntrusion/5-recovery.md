No matter how far the hacker has gone into the system and the knowledge you might have about the compromission, as long as the system has been penetrated, the best practice is **to reinstall the system fully from original media and apply all fixes to the newly installed system**.

In case this solution can’t be applied, you should:

- **Change all the system’s accounts passwords**, and make your users do so in a secure way: they should use passwords with upper/lower case, special characters, numbers, and at least be 8 characters long.
- **Restore all files** that could have been changed (Example: `svchost.exe`) by the attacker.

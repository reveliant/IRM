- Raise user awareness and security policies

  Never give any personal or corporate information to an unidentified person. This could include user IDs, passwords, account information, name, e-mail address, phone (mobile or landline) numbers, address, social security number, job titles, information on clients, organization or IT systems.

  The goal of the social engineer is to steal human resources, corporate secrets or customer/user data.

  **Report any suspicious event to your manager, who will forward it to the CISO in order to have a centralized reporting.**

- Have a defined process to redirect any “weird” request to a “red” phone, if needed.

  Red phone number must be clearly tagged as “Social Engineering”. **The phone number has to be easy to identify in the global phone directory of your company but requests on reverse number should not be displayed.**

  Red phone line should always be recorded for evidence collecting purposes.

- Prepare to handle conversation with social engineers to identify which information could help tracking the attacker and his goals.
- Check your legal department to see which actions are allowed and which reactions they can handle.

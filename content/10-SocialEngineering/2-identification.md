title: Identification
weight: 2
objective: Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate parties.
---
- **Phone call** / someone you don't know calls you/your service, asking for detailed information.
  - If the contact works out of the company and requests for information that could be valuable for a competitor, deny his requests and go to part 3.
  - If the contact pretends to be an employee of your company but the phone number is hidden or not internal, propose that you call back to the declared number in the directory. If the supposedly attacker agrees, call back to check. If he rejects this option, go to part 3.
  
  The attacker might use several techniques to entice his victim to speak (fear, curiosity, empathy ...). Do not disclose information in any case.
  
  Listen carefully to his requests and at the end ask for a phone number to call back or an email address to reply.
  
  Take notes and stay calm, even if the attacker is shouting or threatening, remember he tries to use human weaknesses.
  
  If you can go further, the following information will be precious:

  - the name of the correspondent,
  - requested information / people
  - accent, language skills,
  - industry language and organizational knowledge,
  - background noises
  - time and duration of the call

- **E-mail** / Someone you don't know requests detailed information.
  - If the contact has an “out of the company” e-mail address and requests information that could be valuable for a competitor, go to part 3.
  - If the contact uses an internal e-mail address but is asking for weird information, ask him some explanations and use the company directory to get his manager's name that you'll place as a copy.
- Eventually notify top management to inform them that an incident has been encountered relating to a social engineering attack. They might understand the goals depending on the context.

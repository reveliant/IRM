**At this step, you should be pretty sure that you're dealing with a social engineering attack.**

### Actions for all employees

- **Phone call**
  - If the attacker urges you to give a phone number, follow these steps:
    - Use the “red phone line” from your CERT/CSIRT, if existing.
    - Give him the number with an invented name.
    - Immediately call your CERT/CSIRT team explaining what happened and the chosen invented name.
  - If the attacker stresses you too much and does not let you time to find the Red Phone number, ask him to call you back later, pretending a meeting.
  - If the attacker wants to reach someone, follow these points :
    - Place on hold the attacker and call CERT/CSIRT team and explain what happened
    - Transfer the conversation of the attacker to CERT/CSIRT team (do not give him the number)
- **E-mail**
  - Forward to your security team all email including headers (send as attached documents) for investigation purposes. It might help to track the attacker.

### Actions for CERT or incident response team

- **Phone call**
  - Resume the conversation with the attacker and use one of these techniques:
    - Impersonate the identity of the people whom the attacker is willing to speak
    - Slow down and make last the conversation and entice the attacker to make mistake.
    - Explain him that social engineering attack is forbidden by law, punished by sanctions and that lawyer team will handle the issue if it continues
  - If the trap phone number has been used, prepare to “burn it”, create another one and display it in the directory.
- **E-mail**
  - Collect as much information as possible on the email address:
    - Analyze the email headers and try to locate the source
    - Search the e-mail address with Internet tools
    - Geolocalize the user behind the email address
- Aggregate all social engineering attacks to visualize the scheme.

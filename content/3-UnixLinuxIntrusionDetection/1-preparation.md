- A physical access to the suspicious system should be offered to the forensic investigator.
- A physical copy of the hard-disk might be necessary for forensic and evidence purposes. If needed, a physical access could be necessary to disconnect the suspected machine from any network.
- A good knowledge of the usual network activity of the machine/server is needed. You should have a file on a secure place describing the usual port activity, to compare efficiently to the current state.
- A good knowledge of the usual services is needed. Donâ€™t hesitate to ask a Unix/Linux Expert for his assistance, when applicable.
- You should have a regularly updated list of all critical files, (especially SUID and GUID files) stored in a secure place out of the network or even on paper. With this list, you can easily separate usual SUID files and detect unusual ones.
- Have a map of your usual port activity/traffic rules.

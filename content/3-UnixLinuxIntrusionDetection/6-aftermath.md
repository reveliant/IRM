### Report

A crisis report should be written and made available to all of the actors of the crisis management cell. The following themes should be described:

- Actions and timelines
- What went right
- What went wrong
- Incident cost

### Capitalize

Actions to improve the Unix/Linux intrusion detection management processes should be defined to capitalize on this experience.

The remediation part is pretty limited in case of an insider abuse. Following actions can be considered depending on the case:

- Take disciplinary action against the malicious employee (or terminate the contract) and remove all his/her credentials.
- Delete all fictitious or fraudulent operations made by the insider
- Review all programs or scripts made by the insider and remove all unnecessary codes

Insider abuses are hard to detect and there is no 100% success tips.

### Technical identification

#### Alerts from a SIEM or correlation tools

Malicious behaviour can have been detected with the correlation of several abnormal events

#### Alerts from an IDS/IPS detecting an intrusion

In case the insider tried to hack the system, an Intrusion Detection System (or Intrusion Prevention System) can be able to trigger an alert.

### Human identification

#### Management

The manager of the insider might be the first to notice the suspected behaviour.

#### Control, risk, compliance

These teams have their own systems to detect operational anomalies and they can also trigger alerts if something abnormal is detected.

#### Colleagues

Insiderâ€™s colleagues are maybe the most valuable notification channel because they know perfectly the tasks, the process and the impacts on their duty jobs. They can guess easily what is happening.

#### External parties

External partners or structure can also have their own detection capabilities. If operations have been falsified internally, these external entities can bring a real enlightenment.

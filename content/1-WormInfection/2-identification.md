### Detect the infection

Information coming from several sources should be gathered and analyzed:

- Antivirus logs,
- Intrusion Detection Systems,
- Suspicious connection attempts on servers,
- High amount of accounts locked,
- Suspicious network traffic,
- Suspicious connection attempts in firewalls,
- High increase of support calls,
- High load or system freeze,
- High volumes of e-mail sent

If one or several of these symptoms have been spotted, the actors defined in the “preparation” step will get in touch and if necessary, create a crisis cell.

### Identify the infection

Analyze the symptoms to identify the worm, its propagation vectors and countermeasures.

Leads can be found from :

- CERT’s bulletins;
- External support contacts (antivirus companies, etc.) ;
- Security websites (Secunia, SecurityFocus etc.)

Notify Chief Information Security Officer.
Contact your CERT if required.

### Assess the perimeter of the infection

Define the boundaries of the infection (i.e.: global infection, bounded to a subsidiary, etc.).
If possible, identify the business impact of the infection.

objective: Take actions to stop the fraud.

- In case there is a fraudulent web page related to the fraud, hosted on a compromised website, try to contact the owner of the website. Explain clearly the fraud to the owner, so that he takes appropriate actions: remove the fraudulent content, and most of all upgrade the security on it, so that the fraudster cannot come back using the same vulnerability.
- In any case, also contact the hosting company of the website. Send e-mails to the contact addresses of the hosting company (generally there is an abuse@hostingcompany) then try to get someone on the phone, to speed things up.
- Contact the e-mail hosting company to shut down the fraudulent account of the fraudster. Donâ€™t forget to send them a copy of the fraudulent e-mail.

In case you get no answer, or no action is taken, call back and send e-mails on a regular basis.

If the takedown is too slow, contact a local CERT in the involved country, which could help taking down the fraud, and explain them the difficulties you face.

Determine how you can answer to the blackmail and the consequences and costs of ignoring, answering yes or no.

Most common threats tied with blackmail are:

- Denial of service
- Reveal sensitive data on Internet (credit card or other personal data from customers or internal worker/director, confidential company data, etc.)
- Reveal sensitive private information about employees/VIPs
- Block your data access (wiped or encrypted through ransomware for example [^1])
- Mass-mailing using the brand (spam, child pornography [^2], bad rumours, etc.)

### Check the background

- Check if similar blackmailing attempts have taken place in the past. Check if other companies have been threatened as well.
- All related technical data should be checked carefully and collected for investigation purposes;
- Search if anyone would have any interest into threatening your company

  - Competitors
  - Ideologically-motivated groups
  - Former or current employees

- Try to identify the attacker with the available pieces of information.
- More generally, try to find how the attacker got into
the system or got the object of the blackmail.

Contact local law enforcement to inform them.

Try to gain time and details from fraudster. Ask:

- **Proof of what he said: example data, intrusion proof, etc.**
- **Time to get what fraudster wants (money, etc.)**

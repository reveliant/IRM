If a flaw has been identified on a technical asset or a process allowing the attacker to get access to the object of the blackmail, ask for IMMEDIATE fix in order to prevent another case.

- After getting as much information as possible, ignore the blackmail and ensure appropriate watch is in place to detect and react accordingly on any new follow-ups.
- Donâ€™t take any remediation decision alone if strategic assets or human people are targeted. Involve appropriate departments

***Remember that a positive answer to the fraudster is an open door for further blackmails.***

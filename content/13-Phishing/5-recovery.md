Assess the end of the phishing case

- Ensure that the fraudulent pages and/or e-mail address are down.
- Keep monitoring the fraudulent URL. Sometimes a phishing website can reappear some hours later. In case a redirection is used and not taken down, monitor it very closely.
- At the end of a phishing campaign, remove the associated warning page from your website.

### Trademark infringement Detection

- Deploy active monitoring of domain names registration through registries’ zones updates whenever possible or brand alert services such as DomainTools;
- Set up feeds to monitor usernames, pages and groups on social networks;
- Analyze HTTP referrers in website logs to identify fraudulent content downloads and fraudulent mirroring of your websites;
- Set up brand name monitoring with specialized search engines.

Leverage automation whenever possible to trigger alarms and improve reaction times.

### Involve appropriate parties

- As soon as an infringement is detected, contact the people in your company who are accredited to take a decision if you haven’t been empowered to do so on your own.

The decision to act on the fraudulent domain name, group or user account must be taken as soon as possible.

### Collect evidence

- Collect evidence of infringing domain names, websites, specific URLs (e.g. Facebook vanity URL), pages, groups or account details.
- Make a time-stamped copy of the infringing material (page, group, blog, forum, micro-blogging timeline, etc) and take screenshots if possible.
